These files are for the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban PC game.

`UserDefault.ini` is the vanilla configuration file from the game's install, and the `User.ini` file is this file customised to work best for the Steam Deck. It should be copied to `Documents/Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/User.ini`.

The controller configuration was set up on the Steam deck and found after export in `/home/deck/.steam/steam/userdata/33947318/config/controller_configs/apps/2316178672/FVAA2200217F/33947318/2898707330/controller_configuration.vdf`.

Unfortunately, unlike previous games, the joystick axes do not seem to be recognised for movement, so the Steam Deck joystick must be configured as a D-pad instead.

Sometimes the right joystick sensitivity in game will become quite low immediately after loading into a map. I'm not sure why this happens, but it seems to resolve after a minute or so. Using the right trackpad in these situations works fine.
